### 문제 설명

<p>The Eye of Sauron is in the middle of Mordor. He needs to track the tricksy hobbitses as they trek across the land; to do so, the Eye at the top of the Tower must rotate so that it has a good view.</p>

<p>The eye is at coordinates (0,0) facing due east. Given a coordinate in the first quadrant, output the number of degrees from the x-axis to rotate the Eye so that it faces the hobbits.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input is a series of lines representing integer coordinates of the hobbitses as an x and y value. All (x, y) coordinates will be in the first quadrant. The coordinate (0,0) marks the end of input.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output to a newline the number of degrees (rounded to the closest integer) to rotate the Eye. Note that each test case is rotating from the x-axis, not from the previous orientation of the Eye.</p>
