### 문제 설명

<p>For the daily milking, Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 50,000) always line up in the same order. One day Farmer John decides to organize a game of Ultimate Frisbee with some of the cows. To keep things simple, he will take a contiguous range of cows from the milking lineup to play the game. However, for all the cows to have fun they should not differ too much in height.</p>

<p>Farmer John has made a list of Q (1 <= Q <= 200,000) potential groups of cows and their heights (1 <= height <= 1,000,000). For each group, he wants your help to determine the difference in height between the shortest and the tallest cow in the group.</p>

### 입력

	<li>Lines N+2..N+Q+1: Two integers A and B (1 <= A <= B <= N), representing the range of cows from A to B inclusive.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

### 출력
